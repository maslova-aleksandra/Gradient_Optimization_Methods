# Gradient Optimization Methods for Semi-Supervised Binary Classification

This research project investigates and evaluates optimization algorithms for semi-supervised binary classification problems that leverage kernel-based similarity measures. The study focuses on implementing and comparing the performance of three distinct optimization approaches.

**Optimization Methods Evaluated:**
1. **Gradient Descent (GD)** - A fundamental first-order optimization algorithm that iteratively updates parameters in the direction of steepest descent.
2. **Block Coordinate Gradient Descent with Gauss-Southwell Rule (BCGD-GS)** - An advanced coordinate descent method that selects the most promising coordinate block for optimization at each iteration using the Gauss-Southwell selection strategy.
3. **Coordinate Minimization (CM)** - A coordinate-wise optimization technique that sequentially minimizes the objective function with respect to individual coordinates or coordinate blocks.
